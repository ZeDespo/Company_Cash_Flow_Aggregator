# Udacity Cloud DevOps Capstone Project

This project demonstrates working knowledge of both CI/CD practices using blue-green deployment and container orchestration 
using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS with eksctl. 

The items in the "blue" folder contain the "current" django application with a newly implemented update feature, while 
the items in the "green" folder contain the previously backed up version of the application.
